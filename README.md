# Heart-Health-Analysis
I recently worked on a project to analyze vital signs data and assess cardiovascular risk using Python,
Excel, and Machine Learning. The goal was to process health data, detect risks early, and improve accuracy with AI.
ðŸ”¹ What I Did:
âœ” Cleaned and prepared vital signs data (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels).
âœ” Used Excel for data organization and initial analysis.
âœ” Built a Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression) to predict risk levels.
âœ” Evaluated model performance, achieving 92% accuracy.
âœ” Created visual reports and dashboards for easy interpretation.
ðŸ“Š Key Results:
âœ… Early detection of high-risk cases using AI.
âœ… Improved prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods.
âœ… A simple yet effective system combining Excel & Python.
